# Sorting

This project presents a graphical visualization of several sorting algorithms using different types of graphics. The sorting algorithms currently implemented are:

- Binary Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Comb Sort
- Counting Sort
- Cycle Sort
- Double Selection Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Odd-Even Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Selection Sort
- Shell Sort 

Graphics can be dinamically changed, using the Strategy design pattern. The sorting algorithms are separated from the graphics using the Proxy design pattern. Application settings are stored in a properties file using the Singleton design pattern.
